File Descriptions:

.ipynb_checkpoints: Please see the .ipynb files outside the folders, they contain the same code. These notebook files were created for analysis tasks or quick tests. Important ones include, Analysis_energy_over_iteration.ipynb (used for energy descent visualization), Analysis_Time_scaling.ipynb (outdated file for analyzing time-scaling behaviors of ground state, see folder "Time-scaling" with accuracy for the most recent version), spectrum.ipynb (used to generate spectrum plot, based on Alev's original implementation).
